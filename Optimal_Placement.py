        Approach:
        - Use combinations to place buildings in all possible configurations of `n` buildings in a grid.
        - For each configuration, calculate the maximum distance from any cell to the nearest building using BFS.
        - Return the minimum of these maximum distances across all configurations.
        Time Complexity:
        - Generating combinations: O((w*h choose n)) â‰ˆ O((w*h)^n / n!)
        - BFS for each configuration: O(w * h)
        - Overall: O((w*h)^n / n! * w * h)
        Space Complexity:
        - BFS queue: O(w * h)
      
        Any problem you faced while coding this: Iterating over combinations for large grids can be computationally expensive.
